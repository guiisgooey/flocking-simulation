        <h1>What are boids?</h1>
        <p>
        Boids is term short for a bird-like-objects and is used in reference to simple flocking algorithms. A boid has
        3 main traits that determine how it moves in reference to other boids: coherence/cohesion, separation/avoidance, and alignment.
        </p>
        <h2>Cohesion:</h2>
        <p>
        Cohesion/Coherence is the property of how boids group to a center of mass (average position of all boids). A lower
        cohesion value will result in boids moving to the center of mass slower, while a higher cohesion value speeds up this
        process. The end result of Cohesion is one large group of boids with no outliers.
        </p>
        <h2>Separation:</h2>
        <p>
            Separation/Avoidance is the property of how boids stay away from one another. While cohesion groups boids together into
            one mass separation creates empty space between each boid to allow for easy recognition of individual boids. A lower
            separation value will result in less empty space between boids, while a higher separation value will result in more
            empty space. Separation is not a strict boundary. Boids will not be blocked from crashing into each other or entering
            the empty space set by separation. Instead the boidsâ€™ velocities will change to move away from each other in the
            instance that they are too close.
        </p>
        <h2>Alignment:</h2>
        <p>
            Alignment is the property that allows boids to steer near the local heading of the group. This is similar to cohesion as
            it groups boids in a similar direction, however it utilizes the visual range of each boid to determine the direction its
            nearest neighbors are moving in. A higher visual range and alignment value will result in the speeding up of this
            process while a lower visual range and alignment value will make it occur more slowly. The end result of this process is
            boid group members moving in a similar direction.
        </p>
